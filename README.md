# EDA and Customer Segmentation

This project presents an end-to-end exploratory data analysis (EDA) and customer segmentation pipeline. The goal is to understand customer behaviors and uncover distinct customer groups using clustering techniques, supporting targeted marketing strategies and personalized services.

## 🔍 Project Objectives

- Perform exploratory data analysis to uncover insights from customer data.
- Apply data preprocessing techniques to prepare data for modeling.
- Use unsupervised learning (e.g., K-Means clustering) to segment customers.
- Visualize findings and interpret cluster characteristics for actionable insights.
